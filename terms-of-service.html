      <h1>Terms of Service (ToS)</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22 March 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Singxsavor, a multi-service booking platform connecting users with licensed service providers in Singapore and Malaysia. These Terms of Service outline your rights and responsibilities when using our platform, ensuring a safe and secure experience for all users.</p>

      <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
      <p>Singxsavor acts as a digital intermediary to facilitate the booking and coordination of a variety of services provided by third-party vendors. These services include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transportation services (e.g., cross-border transport, school pickups, carpool arrangements)</li>
        <li>Moving services and general travel logistics</li>
        <li>Event management and funeral setup arrangements</li>
        <li>Accommodation booking and pet transportation solutions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that Singxsavor does not directly manage, operate, or provide any of the listed services. All services are delivered by verified, independently licensed providers.</p>

      <h2>3. Booking and Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>Users are not required to create an account to make a booking or subscribe to a service. Instead, information submitted through our platform's forms is automatically relayed to the relevant service providers for processing. By submitting a form on our platform, you express your intention to engage in a contractual relationship directly with the service provider concerned.</p>

      <h2>4. Payments</h2>
      <p>All payments made via Singxsavor are processed securely through our partner gateway, Cryptosgpay. We use modern encryption methods to protect your sensitive data and ensure all transactions are secure. Refunds and cancellations are governed by the terms of the respective service providers. Users are encouraged to review each provider’s individual policies before confirming a booking.</p>

      <h2>5. Disputes and Mediation</h2>
      <p>In the event of a disagreement or conflict between a user and a service provider, Singxsavor can offer assistance as a mediator. However, the final decision-making authority lies with the service provider. Users are encouraged to resolve disputes amicably and directly with the provider where possible.</p>

      <h2>6. Insurance and Liability</h2>
      <p>Services conducted in Singapore include insurance coverage as mandated by local law. For services rendered in Malaysia, users must rely on their personal insurance plans for protection. Singxsavor is not liable for damages, delays, losses, or any mishaps resulting from the services provided. We serve purely as a booking intermediary and do not assume responsibility for operational failures by service providers.</p>

      <h2>7. Communication</h2>
      <p>By using our platform, you consent to receive relevant communications from Singxsavor, including but not limited to booking confirmations, service updates, and promotional content. Communications will primarily be sent via email or SMS. You may unsubscribe from promotional communications at any time by contacting our support team or following the opt-out instructions provided in the message.</p>

      <h2>8. Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service shall be governed and interpreted according to the laws of Malaysia. Any disputes shall fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia.</p>
